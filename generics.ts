// GENERICS 

// Generics allow us to define reusable functions and classes that work with multiple types rather than a single type 

// The syntax is not pretty. They are used all over the place, so it is best to get comfortable with them. 

//const nums: number[] = []
const nums: Array<number> = []
const colors: Array<string> = []
